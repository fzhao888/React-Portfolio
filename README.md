#  React-Portfolio

  ## Description
  I build this React Portfolio web app to help showcase the body of work I have accomplish thus far to recruiters. I know it will help recruiters because:   

  AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, 
  I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples, 
  SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.
